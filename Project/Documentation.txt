Documentation
This app takes in the data parameters of a sample and calculates a P value for a specific type of hypothesis tests â€“ one way or two way. 
The parameters that the app requires are:
- Sample size
- Sample mean
- Sample standard deviation
- The null hypothesis value
- The type of test for which the P value is calculated- right hand test, left hand test or  a two way test.
Once all the parameters are supplied, the app calculates the t statistic for the test, the degrees of freedom and the appropriate P value for the type of test.
Also included is a visual representation of the t distribution and a shaded area that is the P value. 

Hope you like it!
